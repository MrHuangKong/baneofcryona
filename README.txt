This folder contains the files that we will be sharing and editing together. Make sure to edit the files locally on your computer, 
and then copy it to this folder, then submit a push on github. E.g, you're editing the config file for appleskin, make sure you edit 
the apple skin config file that is located in your roaming/.minecraft/config folder, and then copy it over to the github/baneofcryona folder. 
This will ensure that we do not overwrite each others work.
